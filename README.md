# soulFood-Restaurant-GUI-
A GUI using tkinter to create a soul food restaurant menu! Soul food is a variety of cuisine originating in African American culture.  The expression "soul food" originated in the mid-1960s, when "soul" was a common word used to describe African American culture. Future updates will feature the cash feature in where the user can insert an amount of cash and recieve change. At the moment it's experincing bugs with this so I disabled the feature for now.  Two versions with the exact same code called SoulFood.Py and SoulFood.PYW exist in order for downloads can edit the terminal version and the windowed version.
